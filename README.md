-!-What this mod does-!-
------------------------
	A complete overhaul to the endgame loot distribution, complete with new upscaled equipment items, treasure items, and possibly more. 
	This mod also features a comprehensive item upgrade system for the upscaled items that the mod adds. 

	~The Upgrade System~
		Using placed (Small) Shrines to Malacath, the player can pay a fee of gold to upgrade their items to improved versions of themselves. 
		These Shrines are located wherever blacksmiths are located. 

	~Upscaled versions of Vanilla Equipment~
		145 new equipment items have been added using Vanilla assets. 
		There is a separate text file containing the full list of base weapon stats by tier. Note; there are slight variences throughout the items, so use this as a baseline.  [TE_Equipment_Stats.txt]
		
		~Artifacts~
		Dawn/Duskfang have been recast into the twinfaced sword spirit Waning and Rising. This sword behaves identically to the original, in that during the night, it takes on the form of Waning, and during the day, it takes on the form of Rising. Furthermore, as the sword consumes the blood of its victims it will change form again growing stronger. 
		Once the sword has consumed enough, this transformation becomes permanent, and the sword spirit remains Blood Drunk.
		
		The Mehrunes Razor has been recast into the Ebony Razor. This dagger carries a low chance to instantly kill any target it strikes, claiming its soul for Mehrunes Dagon. Similarly to appeasing the sword spirits Waning and Rising, appeasing Mehrunes Dagon's appetite for souls comes with its own reward, Awakening the Daggers true form.
		
-------------------------------
-!-What this mod does not do-!-
-------------------------------
Add new meshes or non-vanilla items to the game.
Add creatures, NPCs, etc. I intend to release mods in this series that overhaul those.
Currently does not allow you to upgrade vanilla items into modded variants, though I am working on it. 
----------------------------------------------
-!-Important-! !-Missing/Invisible Mesh Bug-!-
----------------------------------------------
	After installing and saving your game with the mod installed, do not change the load order position of the mod. 
	
	For example: Once installed, Terrifying_Encounters.esp is on Line Number 20. TesSyncMapInjector has now bound all of the mesh assignments to that Load Order Position. 
	
	Changing the load order position will cause those assignments to be invalid, rendering already spawned in items, objects, and NPCs to be invisible. 
	
	If you need to uninstall a mod above Terrifying_Encounters.Esp, you must shift the load order back so that it stays on line 20. 
	Load this as early as possible, immediately after the Unofficial Oblivion Remastered Patch, and before any other mod if possible. 
	
	If at any point everything becomes invisible and you did not move this mod, ensure that all other SyncMap files are completely valid, as a single misplaced character will brick everything.

Heavily inspired by Enhanced Endgame Loot by ArmlessWunder (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1871)
I learned how scripts work by reading a lot of peoples stuff. Scripts in the "Reference Script" directory are either from Oblivion itself, or from other creators. I will try to credit specific creators for their inspiration. 

I learned how MessageBox menus can work though: 
Sigil Stone Transmuter - Varla Stone Cost by Maegfaer (and Omnishambles9) (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1270)
Menu Handy Options by RamlethalSnake (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1019)
Reopen Oblivion Gates by Velken (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/587)

I learned that I can use CSE to expand the limits of scripting and also read through its scripts to learn how some things work through: 
Auto Upgrade Leveled Items by TheOneTrueRy (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/567)

I learned how to make custom summons through:
Summon War Expanded by TrueElderBlade (https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1521)
